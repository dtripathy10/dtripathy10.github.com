**Lets tracking a sytem:**

+ We are unable to track a system because we don't have notion of Identity.
+ Once we have gave the Identity to a object in a system, then problem is solved.
+ Constraint:-Finite memory of the Manager (manging arbitary identity symbol)
+ To manage memory efficiently:-
   + grouping in homogenous way. Heterogenous would be difficult
   + Need to store symbol, and track symbol by symbol
   + .
   + Need someway to represent the identity symbol in a compact way

**Approach-n:**(Need someway to represent the identity symbol in a compact way)

+ Finally we decided some kind of cyclic symbol is needed and their order will be important for us. And also which cycle it belongs is also important

{% codeblock lang:html Representation of Cyclic Structure of symbol%}

  i k l
  ii ik il
  ki kk kl
  li lk ll
  .......

{% endcodeblock %}

So Finally Identity problem is on our track.

**Operation**

+ Operration on symbol introduce neew symbol. 
    + **Subtraction:** Introduce "SUNYA" and reflection of a symbol on other side.
    + **Division:** Introducing fration symbol
    + **SQUARE ROOR:** Introduce root(n)
    + .
    + .

+ Grouping of Symbol by underdestanding properties of symbol.

**Note:** new symbols are introduced, when new operation are added to system.

**Algebra:**

+ Concept of container/variable: which can take any value with their domain. 
+ Concept of "equal to"/"same as". equality/operation only hold on same types of object.
